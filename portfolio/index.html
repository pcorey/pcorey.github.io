  <!-- <h1>Our Technologies</h1> -->
  <!-- <p>When it comes to technologies, we've been around the block. We’ve put products into production using everything from Flex and Java, to Angular and PHP. Over the years, we’ve come to appreciate some stacks over others.</p> -->

  <h1 id="projects">Our Projects</h1>
  <p>We've worked on many interesting projects over the years. Take a look at a few of our favorites.</p>

  <div class="scalable-real-time-messaging">
    <h2 id="scalable-real-time-messaging">Scalable, Real-Time Messaging</h1>
    <p>The heart and soul of <a href="https://www.admithub.com/">AdmitHub</a>, one of our long-term clients, is real-time messaging. AdmitHub builds messaging products targeted at graduating high school seniors looking for guidance in the collage application process.</p>
    <p>During our time working together, we’ve helped AdmitHub overcome many engineering obstacles related to their real-time messaging platform.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>AdmitHub’s primary medium of interaction with its users is via text message. We use a host of <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> products to manage SMS communications. While Twilio is a fantastic product, it doesn’t come without its rough edges.</p>
    <img class="phone-mockup" src="/img/projects/phone-mockup.png">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to ensure that inbound text messages were never lost, we helped build out a “front-end” micro-service that sits between Twilio and AdmitHub’s application servers. The purpose of this additional layer was to store all incoming messages from Twilio and forward them along to the heavy-weight application server. By keeping the micro-service small, it could be quickly scaled up and down to meet rapidly changing load demands, while never missing a message.</p>
    <p>The system has help up in both testing and real-world high-load situations (college fairs, demonstrations, etc…). With minimal hardware, <b><i>the system has been shown to handle over one thousand concurrent connections while never missing a message</i></b>.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>While text messaging was AdmitHub’s initial bread and butter, they quickly realized that students use a variety of messaging platforms.</p>
    <p>In light of this, we helped AdmitHub unbraid their messaging system’s internal logic from the Twilio-specific transport code. By correctly architecting this abstraction, we were able to add additional messaging transports, such as a web messaging client, and an integration with <a href="https://www.messenger.com/t/1736529336578069">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p>
    <p>By expanding to new messaging mediums, AdmitHub was able to reduce the friction of communicating with students who were reluctant to provide their phone number.</p>

  <div class="in-house-bedcontrol">
    <h2 id="in-house-bedcontrol">In-house Bedcontrol</h2>
    <p>We recently had the pleasure of working on an amazing project with <a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/">Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare</a>.</p>
    <p>Methodist Healthcare is a multi-facility hospital system based out of Memphis, Tennessee. Prior to our engagement, the primary facility in the Methodist system was using a proprietary “Bedcontrol” system designed to track and manage the state of beds within the hospital facility.</p>
    <p>The cost of purchasing additional licenses of the existing Bedcontrol system for use in the other facilities was <b><i>estimated to exceed one million dollars</i></b>.</p>
    <p>Working with a small team of Methodist developers, we began building a Meteor-based in-house version of the Bedcontrol solution. After overcoming some interesting technological obstacles, we rolled our in-house solution to great acclaim, effectively <b><i>saving the company hundreds of thousands of dollars</i></b>.</p>

  <div class="admithub">
    <h2 id="admithub">AdmitHub.com</h2>
    <p>Our first engagement with <a href="https://www.admithub.com">AdmitHub</a> was a security assessment of their Meteor web application. Because building secure software is one of our primary tenets, we were happy to help.</p>
    <p>Our assessment process is an in-depth, hands-on dive into a Meteor application. The goal of each assessment is to tease out any weak points that may leave your application susceptible to malicious users and outside attackers.</p>
    <p>In the months following our assessment, we worked with AdmitHub and several third-party designers to securely build out many front-end features including a real-time chat component, a robust admin backend, and a beautiful student profile system.</p>
