    <p>I’m Pete. I'm an independent consulant, writer, and remote web developer based out of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chattanooga,+TN/">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>.</p>

    <p>Before setting out on my own, I spent over ten years working as a software developer for companies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.cigital.com/">Cigital</a>, <a href="http://www.tapestrysolutions.com/">Tapestry solutions</a>, and <a href="http://www.surgeforward.com/">Surge Forward</a>. My time in the industry has taught me many things about the software development process, business, and people.</p>

    <p>Software is a tool that exists to serve people. In order to help people solve difficult problems, software must have three fundamental qualities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Software must be secure.</em></li>
      <li><em>Software must be robust.</em></li>
      <li><em>Software must be maintainable.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>My work is an embodiment of these three principles. Through both educational resources and hands-on software development, I hope to help software developers and product owners alike realize that well-built, high-quality software is an asset, not a liability.</p>

    <p>If these principles resonate with you, check out <a href="/blog/">my articles</a> to find out what we’ve been thinking about, <a href="/our-work/">my case-studies</a> to read about some of my favorite projects, and <a href="/services/">my services</a> pages to find out how I can help with your current project.</p>
