Last October, I was lucky enough to attend the first ever [Meteor Space Camp](http://meteorspace.camp/)! True to its "unconference" roots, the weekend was punctuated by fantastic talks on a variety of [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) topics, by a collection of amazing Meteor developers.

I decided to give a talk on Meteor security with a heavy focus on the importance of making assertions about user-provided data. The talk was called, "Why You Should Always Check Your Arguments", and itâ€™s [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hj8dlBK_hQ)!

</div>

Take a look, and be sure to ___always check your arguments___!
