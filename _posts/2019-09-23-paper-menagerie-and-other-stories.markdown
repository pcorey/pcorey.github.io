[Paper Menagerie and Other Stories](https://amzn.to/330jTvS) is an amazing collection of science fiction and fantasy short stories written by Ken Liu.

Starting with _Paper Menagerie_, and working my way through the other short stories in this collection, I was absolutely blown away. The style, tone, and subject of many of the stories in this collection distinctly remind me of Ted Chiang, but with a stronger emphasis on the "human experience".

Ken Liu is Ted Chiang with soul.

_The Literomancer_ and _Paper Menagerie_ are heart wrenching. _The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species_ and _An Advanced Readers’ Picture Book of Comparative Cognition_ are amazing explorations of alien life (and our own, in reflection). _Mono No Aware_ is a beautiful ode to the game of Go, and _The Litigation Master and the Monkey King_ is a nod to [The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas).

> The bits were his, but not _him_.

> We are now a race of cyborgs. We long ago began to spread our minds into the electronic realm, and it is no longer possible to squeeze all of ourselves back into our brains.

> There is no clarity, no relief. At the end of all rationality, there is simply the need to decide and the faith to live through, to endure.

> But being the mirrors for each other’s souls has a cost: by the time they part from each other, the individuals in the mating pair have become indistinguishable. Before their merger, they each yearned for the other; as they part, they part from the self. The very quality that attracted them to each other is also, inevitably, destroyed in their union.

> It is the fate of every species to disappear into the void that is the heat death of the universe. But long before then, the thoughts of any intelligent species worthy of the name will become as grand as the universe itself.

> “There are no heroes in Go,” Bobby says stubbornly. I don’t know how to answer him.

> The universe is wondrous.
