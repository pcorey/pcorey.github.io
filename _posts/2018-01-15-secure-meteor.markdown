For the past three years, I’ve been writing and speaking about Meteor security, building and deploying secure Meteor applications, working with amazing teams to better secure their applications, and building security-focused packages and tools for the Meteor ecosystem.

Needless to say, I’ve learned a lot over that time.

I’m excited to announce that I’ve started work on a new project called [Secure Meteor](http://www.securemeteor.com/) in an attempt to capture and distill everything I know about Meteor security into an easily understandable, actionable guide to building secure Meteor applications.

[Secure Meteor](http://www.securemeteor.com/) is still very much in its early days, so there’s not much to share yet. That said, as a teaser and a token of thanks for showing interest in the project, __I want to give you the most detailed Meteor security checklist available anywhere, _for free_!__

Be sure to [sign up to receive your free security checklist](http://www.securemeteor.com/#sign-up), and let me know what you’d like to see in the project.
