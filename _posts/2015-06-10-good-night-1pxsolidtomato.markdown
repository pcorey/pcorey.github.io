Good night, 1pxsolidtomato. It’s been a fun ride.

It’s been nearly one year since I put up my first post on [1pxsolidtomato.com](1pxsolidtomato.com). Since then, I’ve transitioned into being an active member of the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) community, and I've started my own [web development company](http://www.east5th.co/) orbiting the Meteor platform.

In an effort to consolodate my blog with my work, I’m putting an end to 1pxsolidtomato and moving all of my posts and articles under [blog.east5th.co](http://blog.east5th.co/). Rest assured, you can continue to expect weekly posts about Meteor development and security.

This transition marks the beginning of a series of changes coming to East5th. Stay tuned for as we continue to delve into the world of Meteor!
