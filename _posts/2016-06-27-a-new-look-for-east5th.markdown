Things may look a bit different around here. I’m excited and relieved to finally release a design overhaul that I’ve been working on for the past several weeks.

The main goal of this redesign is to bring all things East5th under a single roof. No longer are things haphazardly scattered between three different subdomains and a variety of hosting services. Everything we have to offer can now be found at [www.east5th.co](/).

All of our old blog content is still alive and well and can now be found at [www.east5th.co/blog/](/blog/). Be sure to check out our newly unified [services](/services) page, and our brand new collection of [case-studies](/our-work).

<hr/>

When we get down to the nitty gritty details, things are still fundamentally the same. Now, the entire site is a collection of static pages built and generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Keeping things simple, we’re still relying on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting, and using our previously described [Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/explore) setup to schedule and release future blog posts.

[Zapier Named Variables - Scheduling Posts Part 2](/blog/2015/01/05/zapier-named-variables-scheduling-posts-part-2/)

Last, but not least, we’re using a slightly modified [Prism](http://prismjs.com/index.html) for all of our inline and block syntax highlighting needs.

This redesign is just the beginning on a larger set of infrastructure changes planned for East5th.

One of these upcoming changes will involve building out a Meteor backend application that communicates with a Serverless microservice. I’m planning on documenting and publishing the entire process behind building this service.

Stay tuned!
