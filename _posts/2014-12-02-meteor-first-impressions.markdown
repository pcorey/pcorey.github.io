Recently I've been trying out the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) platform. Needless to say, I'm pretty pumped about it:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 25px; height: 0;">
    <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AsdZKyVQ9IE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

But seriously, from what I've read and experienced so far, I'm very excited about what Meteor has to offer. Going through the [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/install) and seeing realtime data binding happening from the HTML template all the way up to the database is mind-blowing! In a [previous post](/blog/2014/10/01/firebase-tustacr/) I wrote about my love for [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) and my dreams for a realtime system architecture. Meteor seems like an amazing step in that direction. I'm looking forward to doing a lot more work with it in the near future!
