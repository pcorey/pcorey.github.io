You may have noticed that I haven't posted a new article in the past four weeks. In fact, ___I haven't done anything in the past four weeks___.

What gives?

I've been in the process of moving cross-country from San Diego, California to Chattanooga, Tennessee. After a few highly chaotic weeks, I'm finally moved in and mostly settled (although I'm currently using the free `Pool&Cabana Wifi`{:.language-*} until we finish our Internet installation). I'm very excited to be in Tennessee, and I'm looking forward to soaking in the area's culture and getting to know the local software developers.

My unannounced hiatus is over; now back to our regularly scheduled programming. Check back next Monday for a new software post!
