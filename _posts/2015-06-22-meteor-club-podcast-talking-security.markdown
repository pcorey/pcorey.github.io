Recently I got to sit down with [Josh Owens](https://twitter.com/joshowens), [Ben Strahan](https://twitter.com/_benstr), and [Dean Radcliffe](https://twitter.com/chicagogrooves) on the [Meteor Club Podcast](https://podcast.meteorjs.club/). We talked about [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) security and how we got started with Meteor.

While you’re at it, you should definitely join [Meteor Club](https://www.patreon.com/meteorclub?ty=h). The private Slack chat is an invaluable resource if you’re serious about Meteor development. Plus, I'm almost always hanging out there!
