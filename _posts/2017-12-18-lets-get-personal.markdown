Two and a half years ago I officially incorporated my first company and started my independent consulting career under the name “East5th, Inc.”

At that time, I really didn’t know what I wanted out of my business, or what it would ultimately grow into. When deliberating whether to go into business under my own name or under the guise of a company, I figured that working behind a fictional entity would be the safer choice.

Over the years, I’ve come to realize that this was the wrong choice for me.

Fun fact: I picked the name “East5th, Inc.” because:

1. I lived on East 5th Avenue.
2. My accountant suggested I tack “Inc.” to the end because, well, that's just what you do.

## Pros and Cons

You’re afforded certain freedoms when you do business as a fictional entity. You're able to easily scale your business to multiple employees, which in turns lets you easily distance yourself from your business and eventually exit.

I don’t want either of these things. 

When I first started out on my own, I imagined building a small team around myself and managing projects entirely in-house from start to finish. While I've done some of that and I do enjoy it, I've found that I do my best work when I deeply integrate myself into an existing team or project. I want to focus on the technical aspects of my work, not the complexities of managing a team.

I've also come to the realization that I don't want an exit strategy. I've never been happier with my career than I am right now. I love the teams I've worked with over the years, and I love the projects we've worked on together. I love writing and sharing the things I'm excited about with the world.

I'm in this for life.

## Good Night, East5th

All of that is a roundabout way of saying that I’ve made the decision to drop the “East5th” name. Effective immediately, this site will become `www.petecorey.com`{:.language-javascript}. Old links to `www.east5th.co`{:.language-javascript} will continue to work and redirect to the new domain. Additionally I've renamed my Medium account from "@east5th" to [@petecorey](https://medium.com/@petecorey).

I’m hoping this change will bring a me a new set of freedoms, like the freedom to be more honest, open, and authentic with my writings and projects.
