I recently ran across [this comment on the Elixir forums](https://elixirforum.com/t/is-it-possible-to-define-structs-at-runtime/62537/8). It's a thing of beauty.

> This is a dark magic, but there is no need to limit yourself, be expressive, break laws, make people be afraid of yourself and make them treat your code with fear and respect.

In a world of best practices, this is the kind of energy we need. Thank you, VOUwCNOD.
