Last week I stumbled upon [Sacha Greif's](http://sachagreif.com/) [Crater post](https://crater.io/posts/c4aeY6evYZZoR9kWs) about becoming a [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com/) tutor. I decided that this would be a great opportunity to flex my teaching muscles and help others learn about [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)!

I've scheduled a Hangout at 9:00 AM, Pacific Time, this Wednesday morning (4/22). We'll be going over the Templates chapter of Discover Meteor (Chapter 3). We'll spend the first 40 minutes going through the chapter, followed by a 20 minute block set aside for questions and answers. If you're interested, check out the [CodeBuddies event](http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/posts/58pB2ZzCdZfZhuxh4) and sign up. See you then!
