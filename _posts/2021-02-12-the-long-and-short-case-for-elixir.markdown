I recently landed a new contract with a client gracious enough to hear my thoughts about why they should make radical changes to their stack and choose Elixir to build their greenfield data pipeline.

As part of my pitch, I put together two documents:

- [The Long Case for Elixir](/notes/the-long-case-for-elixir/)
- [The Short Case for Elixir](/notes/the-short-case-for-elixir/)

The “long case” is a detailed, low level document that outlines why Elixir might be a better choice than Node.js for building the server in question. The “short case” is a distilled and higher level version of the longer document, intended for the project owner.

May these documents help you as much as they’ve helped me. If you have any suggestions for improving them, [please let me know](mailto:hello@petecorey.com)!
