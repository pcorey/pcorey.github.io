You may have noticed that I haven’t been doing much publicly in 2019. I haven’t released any new articles, I haven’t send out any newsletters, and I’ve been relatively quiet [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/petecorey).

Underneath the surface of this calm lake of inactivity, my little duck feet have been churning. I’ve been pursuing [one of my main goals for the new year](https://twitter.com/petecorey/status/1087483455493959680) and working diligently to finish my first book, [Secure Meteor](http://www.securemeteor.com/). __I’m excited to announce that I’ll be releasing [Secure Meteor](http://www.securemeteor.com/) early next week!__

Between the years of 2014 and 2017, I lived and breathed Meteor security. I spent those years writing and speaking about Meteor security, developing and deploying secure Meteor applications, working with amazing teams to better secure their Meteor applications, and building security-focused packages and tools for the Meteor ecosystem.

While Meteor doesn’t play as central of a role in my day-to-day development work today, it would be a shame to throw away all of the knowledge and expertise I built up around the ins-and-outs of securing Meteor applications.

__[Secure Meteor](http://www.securemeteor.com/) is an effort to capture and distill everything I’ve learned about Meteor security from my years of real-world Meteor security experience.__

I’m happy to announce that [over a year after originally announcing Secure Meteor](/blog/2018/01/15/secure-meteor/), it’s ready to be released! The final product is one hundred ten pages of what I consider to be vitally important information on securing your Meteor application. If you are actively developing Meteor applications, or own a Meteor application living in production, Secure Meteor can help bring you understanding and peace of mind in the unforgiving world of software security.

Be sure to [check out a few of the sample chapters](http://www.securemeteor.com/#table-of-contents) to whet your whistle for next week's release.

If you're interested in the book, [sign up for the Secure Meteor newsletter](http://www.securemeteor.com/#sign-up). Subscribers will be the first to know when Secure Meteor launches, and I might even offer them an initial discount for all of their support.

I couldn't be more excited for next week. See you then!
