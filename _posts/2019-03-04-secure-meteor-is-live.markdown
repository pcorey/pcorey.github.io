The big day is finally here. __Secure Meteor is live and [available for purchase](https://www.securemeteor.com/#buy)!__

Secure Meteor is the culmination of all of my work as a Meteor security professional. Between the years of 2014 and 2017 I completely immersed myself in [the Meteor ecosystem](https://www.meteor.com/) and became increasingly focused on the unique security characteristics of Meteor applications. I [wrote](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/tags/#security) and [spoke](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2016/03/21/nosql-injection-in-modern-web-applications/) about Meteor security,built security-focused [tools](https://github.com/East5th/package-scan) and [packages](https://github.com/East5th/check-checker) for the Meteor ecosystem, and [worked hands-on](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2016/05/30/anatomy-of-an-assessment/) with talented teams to better secure their Meteor applications. Secure Meteor is the embodiment of everything I learned about Meteor security during that time.

It’s my goal that reading Secure Meteor will teach you the ins and outs of the various attack vectors present in your Meteor application, and will also teach you how to see your application through the eyes of a potential attacker.

Check out [the Secure Meteor page](https://www.securemeteor.com/) for more details, [samples chapters](https://www.securemeteor.com/#table-of-contents), and to __[snag your copy today](https://www.securemeteor.com/#buy)__!

On a personal note, it’s been over a year since I first announced and started working on Secure Meteor. There were many times over the past year when I never thought I’d finish. Writing a book has always been a personal goal of mine, and I couldn’t be more happy to have persevered and seen this project through to completion.

I deeply believe that Secure Meteor is a valuable addition to the Meteor community, and __I’m happy to be giving back to a community that has given so much to me over the years__.

Thanks for all of your support.
