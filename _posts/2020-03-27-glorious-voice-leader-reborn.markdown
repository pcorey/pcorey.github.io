I recently finished a major visual overhaul of my current pet project, [Glorious Voice Leader](https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/). The redesign was primarily intended to give musicians a (hopefully) more natural interface for working with the tool.

Originally, [Glorious Voice Leader](https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/) displayed its chord suggestions as a series of horizontal fretboards stacked vertically:

<div style="width: 100%; margin: 4em 0;">
  <img src="/img/2020-03-27-glorious-voice-leader-reborn/old.png" style="display: block; margin:1em auto; width: 100%;"/>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: #ccc; margin: 0;">The old Glorious Voice Leader.</p>
</div>

This gave the guitarist lots of control, but it wasn’t a natural way for them to interact with or consume a chord progression.

Instead, I decided to transition to a more familiar chart-based design where every chord in the progression is represented by a small chord chart that should be familiar to any guitarist. The chord currently being added or modified is also displayed on a full fretboard laid out vertically on the side of the page:

<div style="width: 100%; margin: 4em 0;">
  <img src="/img/2020-03-27-glorious-voice-leader-reborn/new.png" style="display: block; margin:1em auto; width: 100%;"/>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: #ccc; margin: 0;">The newly redesigned Glorious Voice Leader.</p>
</div>

The redesign was largely a cosmetic overhaul. A few new minor features were added in the process, such as progressive chord naming, and better keyboard controls, but the meat of [Glorious Voice Leader](https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/) is all still there. Your old saved URLs will still work!

Check out [Glorious Voice Leader](https://www.gloriousvoiceleader.com/) now! And while I’ve got you hooked, be sure to [read more about the project](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2019/09/30/all-hail-glorious-voice-leader/) and [it’s roots in my other projects](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/tags/#chord).
