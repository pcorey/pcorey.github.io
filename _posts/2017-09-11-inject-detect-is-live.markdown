My latest project, [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) is officially live and open to the public! If you have a Meteor application and you’re concerned about the threat of NoSQL Injection, I made this for you!

[As I mentioned last week](http://www.east5th.co/blog/2017/08/28/inject-detect-is-launching-soon/), it’s been a long and winding road to the launch of [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/), but I couldn’t be happier with the results.

My original goals in building [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) were to help safeguard Meteor application owners and developers from the most common vulnerability I’ve seen in Meteor applications: [NoSQL Injection](http://www.injectdetect.com/education/what-is-nosql-injection/). I wanted to offer a more affordable and effective alternative to my hands-on [security assessment process](http://www.east5th.co/services/). [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) is the result.

[Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) is designed to detect and notify you of potential NoSQL Injection attacks as they happen in your application. It does this by building up a set of “expected queries” and [monitoring for any queries that are structurally dissimilar](http://www.injectdetect.com/education/how-do-we-detect-nosql-injection/) from any of the queries in that set.

In an “always on” utility service, affordability is key. [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) uses a [“pay-as-you-go” pricing structure](http://www.injectdetect.com/pricing/) where every processed query costs a mere one one hundredth of a cent ($0.0001). This means that the peace of mind afforded by [Inject Detect’s](http://www.injectdetect.com/) watchful eye will never break your project’s bank.

In addition to using a “pay-as-you-go” pricing structure, I’m also giving new users an initial ten dollar ($10.00) account credit so you can try out [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) on the house for as long as that balance lasts you.

I’m incredibly excited to see how [Inject Detect](http://www.injectdetect.com/) can safeguard your application and your data. Don’t hesitate to reach out and let me know if you have any comments, feedback, or questions about the project.
