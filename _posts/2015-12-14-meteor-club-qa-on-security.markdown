A few weeks ago, I had the chance to do a [Meteor Club Q&A](https://meteorjs.club/) with [Josh Owens](http://joshowens.me/). We spent an hour or so talking about various topics revolving around [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and Meteor security and answering questions submitted by the community. The whole process was a lot of fun. You should [check out the whole Q&A on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaKOqcutkdc), or take a look below:

</div>

During the Q&A, we covered a variety of topics ranging from data-in-motion/data-at-rest security, to the positives and negatives of collection validators, all the way through to best practices for securing multi-tenant Meteor applications.

Do you have any questions about Meteor security that we didn't discuss in the Q&A? If so, [shoot me a tweet](https://twitter.com/petecorey), or [send me an email](mailto:hello@east5th.co)!
