I’m Pete. I'm an independent consulant, remote web developer, and writer based out of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Denver,+CO/">Denver, Colorado</a>.

Before setting out on my own over five years ago, I spent ten years working as a software developer for companies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.cigital.com/">Cigital</a>, <a href="http://www.tapestrysolutions.com/">Tapestry solutions</a>, and <a href="http://www.surgeforward.com/">Surge Forward</a>. My time in the industry has taught me many things about the software development process, business, and people.

Since then, I’ve had the chance to work with many amazing teams applying what I know to build robust software, improve people lives, and bring real value to organizations.

Here’s a sampling of some of my favorite projects:

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="/work/patient-rounding-with-methodist"><strong>Patient Rounding with Methodist</strong></a> - Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, the largest hospital system in Memphis, Tennessee, was able to save a quarter of a million dollars per year by switching to an in-house software solution that I helped architect and build.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="/work/secure-meteor"><strong>Secure Meteor</strong></a> - I wrote Secure Meteor as a culmination of all my time spent evangelizing Meteor security and helping teams to better secure their applications.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="/work/real-time-bed-control-with-methodist"><strong>Real-time Bed Control with Methodist</strong></a> - Read about how the Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis, Tennessee saved millions in licencing costs by switching off of third-party internal software, and onto a system that I helped develop.</li>
<li><a href="/work/scalable-messaging-at-admithub"><strong>Scalable Messaging at AdmitHub</strong></a> - I helped AdmitHub build a scalable SMS messaging system that allowed them to increase the size their user base by a factor of ten and quadruple their average user engagement rates.</li>
</ul>
