<a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/">Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare</a> is a multi-facility hospital system based out of Memphis, Tennessee. Prior to our engagement, the primary facility in the Methodist system was using a proprietary “Bed Control” system designed to track and manage the state of beds within the facility.

The cost of purchasing additional licenses of the existing Bed Control system for use in the other facilities was estimated to exceed one million dollars.

Working with a small team of Methodist developers, I began building an in-house, Meteor-based Bed Control solution. After overcoming some <a href="/blog/2016/04/18/blaze-meets-clusterizejs/">interesting technological obstacles</a>, we delivered our real-time, fully auditable, HIPAA compliant Bed Control application to great acclaim.

At the end of the day, <strong>our in-house solution was able to effectively save the company millions of dollars</strong> in licensing costs.
