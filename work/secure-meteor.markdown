I wrote [Secure Meteor](https://www.securemeteor.com/) over a course of fourteen months, and published it in March of 2019. The book represents the culmination of all of my work evangelizing __Meteor__ security and working professionally with software teams to better secure their Meteor applications.

Secure Meteor is one hundred nine pages filled with literally everything I’ve come to know about Meteor security and best practices for writing secure Meteor-based applications.
