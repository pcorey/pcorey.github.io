My name is Pete Corey. I am software developer, hear me roar. This [blog](/blog/) is a collection of my thoughts on a variety of topics related to web development, programming in general, software security and anything else I find interesting.

When I'm not climbing a web stack, I enjoy making music, cooking and watching music and cooking videos on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=FL-3opJUBM36mPjDRRhJs1PA).

I've worked at a variety of places like CDM Technologies, [Tapestry Solutions](https://www.tapestrysolutions.com/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and [Surge Forward](http://www.surgeforward.com/). I'm currently self-employed and available for hire at [East5th](http://www.east5th.co).

Send me an email and say [hello](mailto:hello@1pxsolidtomato.com)!
