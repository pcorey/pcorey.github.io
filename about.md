My name is Pete Corey. I am software developer, hear me roar. I'm also really into music, cooking and watching music and cooking videos on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=FL-3opJUBM36mPjDRRhJs1PA).

I've worked at a variety of places like CDM Technologies, [Tapestry Solutions](https://www.tapestrysolutions.com/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and I'm currently working as a contractor for [Surge Forward](http://www.surgeforward.com/).

Send me an email and say [hello](mailto:hello@1pxsolidtomato.com)!
