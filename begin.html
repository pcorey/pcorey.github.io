    <p>Soon, you'll receive an email with a link to a short questionnaire about your project. This survey should only take a few minutes to fill out, and it will give us valuable insights into your project.</p>
    <p>In the days after you submit your questionnaire, we'll review it and reach out to set up an initial call to further discuss the project and our next steps.</p>
