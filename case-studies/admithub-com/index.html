      <!-- <p>Our first engagement with <a href="https://www.admithub.com">AdmitHub</a> was a security assessment of their Meteor web application.</p> -->
      <!-- <img src="/img/projects/profile.png"> -->
      <!-- <p>Our assessment process is an in-depth, hands-on dive into a Meteor application. The goal of each assessment is to tease out any weak points that may leave the application susceptible to malicious users and outside attackers.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>At the end of our assessment, we were able to remediate several undiscovered vulnerabilities and leave the AdmitHub team with the knowledge required to continue building their platform in a secure, robust way.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>In the months following our assessment, we worked with AdmitHub and several third-party designers to securely build out many front-end features including a real-time chat component, a robust admin backend, and a comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing student profile system.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>These additional features led to greater user engagement, and the additional administrator tools empowered the non-technical AdmitHub team members to carry out complex actions without the technical and financial burden of new development.</p> -->

      <p>Our first engagement with our friends over at <a href="https://www.admithub.com/">AdmitHub</a> came in the form of a security assessment. </p>

      <p>The folks at AdmitHub came to us concerned about the state of their Meteor application. They had been reading articles about the difficulties and potential dangers of using <code class="language-javascript">allow</code> and <code class="language-javascript">deny</code> rules in Meteor applications, and feared they were vulnerable. To ease their worries, they wanted an expert assessment of the current state of their application.</p>

      <img src="/img/projects/profile.png">

      <p>Before diving into our assessment, we sat down with the AdmitHub CTO, Andrew Magliozzi, and discussed AdmitHub and the current state of Meteor security. We worked together to identify areas of particular sensitivity within their application and business domain. By establishing a business context, we could focus our assessment and ensure that the most valuable assets fell under the most intense scrutiny during our assessment.</p>

      <p>Armed with the information Andrew gave us, we began our assessment. We scoured the AdmitHub application high and low looking for vulnerabilities, bugs, and flaws that may lead to an attack by a malicious user.</p>

      <p>After several days, we returned with a report of our findings. We sat down with the AdmitHub team and went over our findings in detail, presenting outlines and proof-of-concepts for each discovered vulnerability, along with severity ratings, and steps for remediation.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we suggested an immediate course of action to fix the vulnerabilities we discovered, and worked with the AdmitHub team to shore up all of the issues we found.</p>

      <p>We here at East5th love engagements like this.</p>

      <p>Weâ€™re able to transform uncertainty and fear into understanding and confidence. By showing teams the value of their assets in the harsh light of a vulnerability demonstration and then arming them with the exact steps and knowledge needed to secure their application, <strong><em>we instill a deep sense of reverence around the security process and a deeper understanding of the value of their business</em></strong>.</p>
