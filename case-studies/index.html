    <p>Since our doors first opened, we’ve had the pleasure of working on a host of fantastic projects with an amazing group of clients:</p>

    <p>While all of the projects we've worked on hold a special place in our heart, we've curated a selection of our favorites to share with the world. We feel these projects are notable because they emphasize tenets we hold dear, and showcase our skills and abilities as software development professionals.</p>

    <div class="scalable-real-time-messaging">
      <h1 class="portfolio-header" id="scalable-real-time-messaging">Scalable Messaging</h1>
      <p>The heart and soul of <a href="https://www.admithub.com/">AdmitHub</a>, one of our long-term clients, is real-time messaging. AdmitHub builds messaging products targeted at graduating high school seniors looking for guidance in the college application process.</p>
      <p>During our time working together, we’ve helped AdmitHub overcome many engineering obstacles related to their real-time messaging platform.</p>
      <p>By overcoming these challenges, <b><i>we were able to help AdmitHub increase their user base by nearly tenfold and quadrupled the average engagement of users on the platform</i></b>.</p>
      <h1>Twilio</h1>
      <p>AdmitHub’s primary medium of interaction with its users is via text message. We use a host of <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> products to manage SMS communications. While Twilio is a fantastic product, it doesn’t come without its rough edges.</p>
      <img class="phone-mockup" src="/img/projects/phone-mockup.png">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to ensure that inbound text messages were never lost, we helped build out a “front-end” micro-service that sits between Twilio and AdmitHub’s application servers. The purpose of this additional layer was to store all incoming messages from Twilio and forward them along to the heavy-weight application server. By keeping the micro-service small, it could be quickly scaled up and down to meet rapidly changing load demands, while never missing a message.</p>
      <p>The system has held up in both testing and real-world high-load situations (college fairs, demonstrations, etc…). With minimal hardware, <b><i>the system has been shown to handle over one thousand concurrent connections while never missing a message</i></b>.</p>
      <h1>Facebook and Web</h1>
      <p>While text messaging was AdmitHub’s initial bread and butter, they quickly realized that students use a variety of messaging platforms.</p>
      <p>In light of this, we helped AdmitHub unbraid their messaging system’s internal logic from the Twilio-specific transport code. By correctly architecting this abstraction, we were able to add additional messaging transports, such as a web messaging client, and an integration with <a href="https://www.messenger.com/t/1736529336578069">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p>
      <p>By expanding to new messaging mediums, AdmitHub was able to reduce the friction of communicating with students who were reluctant to provide their phone number.</p>

    <div class="in-house-bedcontrol">
      <h1 class="portfolio-header" id="in-house-bedcontrol">Methodist Bedcontrol</h1>
      <p>We recently had the pleasure of working on an amazing project with <a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/">Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare</a>.</p>
      <p>Methodist Healthcare is a multi-facility hospital system based out of Memphis, Tennessee. Prior to our engagement, the primary facility in the Methodist system was using a proprietary “Bedcontrol” system designed to track and manage the state of beds within the hospital facility.</p>
      <p>The cost of purchasing additional licenses of the existing Bedcontrol system for use in the other facilities was estimated to exceed one million dollars.</p>
      <p>Working with a small team of Methodist developers, we began building an in-house, Meteor-based Bedcontrol solution. After overcoming some <a href="/blog/2016/04/18/blaze-meets-clusterizejs/">interesting technological obstacles</a>, we delivered our real-time, fully auditable, HIPAA compliant Bedcontrol application to great acclaim.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, <b><i>our solution was able to effectively save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars</i></b> in licensing costs.</p>

    <div class="admithub">
      <a href="/case-studies/admithub-com"><h1 class="portfolio-header" id="admithub">AdmitHub.com</h1></a>
      <p>Our first engagement with our friends over at <a href="https://www.admithub.com/">AdmitHub</a> came in the form of a security assessment. </p>

      <p>The folks at AdmitHub came to us concerned about the state of their Meteor application. They had been reading articles about the difficulties and potential dangers of using <code class="language-javascript">allow</code> and <code class="language-javascript">deny</code> rules in Meteor applications, and feared they were vulnerable. To ease their worries, they wanted an expert assessment of the current state of their application.</p>

      <img src="/img/projects/profile.png">

      <p>Before diving into our assessment, we sat down with the AdmitHub CTO, Andrew Magliozzi, and discussed AdmitHub and the current state of Meteor security. We worked together to identify areas of particular sensitivity within their application and business domain. By establishing a business context, we could focus our assessment and ensure that the most valuable assets fell under the most intense scrutiny during our assessment.</p>

      <p>Armed with the information Andrew gave us, we began our assessment. We scoured the AdmitHub application high and low looking for vulnerabilities, bugs, and flaws that may lead to an attack by a malicious user.</p>

      <p>After several days, we returned with a report of our findings. We sat down with the AdmitHub team and went over our findings in detail, presenting outlines and proof-of-concepts for each discovered vulnerability, along with severity ratings, and steps for remediation.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we suggested an immediate course of action to fix the vulnerabilities we discovered, and worked with the AdmitHub team to shore up all of the issues we found.</p>

      <p>We here at East5th love engagements like this.</p>

      <p>We’re able to transform uncertainty and fear into understanding and confidence. By showing teams the value of their assets in the harsh light of a vulnerability demonstration and then arming them with the exact steps and knowledge needed to secure their application, <strong><em>we instill a deep sense of reverence around the security process and a deeper understanding of the value of their business</em></strong>.</p>
